			THE SAWAT VALLEY
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> The most beautiful valley i have ever seen and by far the most easy to acess place in KPK. The motroways connect mingora(the base of SAWAT) to Islamabad. Tourism in SAWAT keeps taking hits sadly whether it is because of Talibans or constant flooding as the river SAWAT is extremely strong  </p>
