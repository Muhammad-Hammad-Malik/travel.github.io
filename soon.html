			THE SOON VALLEY 
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> Home, that is what this place is to me so i might be a little biased in my approach. Located in the salt ranges of Potohar region,this beautiful valley has long eluded the public eye and perhaps that is the reason this place is pretty well preserved . Not alot of toursists go there due to somewhat harsh weather but once in a while the clouds cover the sun and cool breeze starts to flow and this becomes heaveb on earth. Ths soon valley is largely undiscovered and therefore we dont know all the beautiful places here but some of the distinct ones are just below this mesmerizing video </p>

			THE UCHALI JHEEL 
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> Ever wondered how it feels like to walk on water? well now you can (or ride a bike whatever helps you sleep at night). This lake is famous for its road that you can see in the below picture goes through the middle of the lake. At sunset, it is a nice calm place to find the peace you are looking for. The lake is very beautiful if the fungus clears just dont fall in it !!! </p>

		<h1>
			THE KHABEKI JHEEL 
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> This one is much clearer than the latter but it isnt that extraordinary. Infact the only thing extra-ordinary about this lake is that the government cared enought to build a sort of pavemnet and hanged 12 boards to celebrate thier achievement . And yes you can do boating here if you are up for that </p>

		<h1>
			Daip Shareef 
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> A cool and nice place to go for a swim (or is it ?). Well my brother certainly wouldnt advise you to attempt such a thing but then again he isnt really much of a swimmer. Do be careful tho as it is atleast 50ft deep . you can also do a bit of a hike and go to the top of waterfall and there are some thousands year old horseprints engraved on a stone there </p>

			Gousar valley  
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> By far the most beautiful place in the entire SOON VALLEY. I even own a mountain there , which one i do not know sadly but that doesnt stop the flex does it? There are vast farmlands here as this is the most ideal place to herd cattle and the area is also of interest to nuclear commission for some reason so movement might be restricted </p>

		<h1>
			SAKESAR 
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> The peak of the valley , standing at 1500m above sea level Sakesar is the world's largest salt range mountain and due to its tactical postion, it houses the most advanced radar system of the country. The view from the top is absolutely sensational. Sadly, it isnt a tourist spot and you can't visit without special permissions </p>

		<h1>
			Mai Wali Dheri  
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> A peculiar name , and the reason behind this name is unknown to me . What I do know is that the air from 2 provinces collides at this peak and it has a particular shape that can enable it to be seen from miles out . It is a tricky climb tho so be careful !! </p>

		<h1>
			Kanhatti Garden  
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> The least exciting place on this list is the government-developed kanhatti garden . It is a big area so you can roam around a bit there is also a fountain here that i never visited but the road th this area is pretty enjoyable like a jalebi of sort but even that is very short </p>
