			THE HUNZA VALLEY
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> The Ruby mines are famous tourist attractions. The Hunza valley is popular for its snow-capped and rough mountains. Many people came to Hunza just to get a few glimpses of the shining ice wall of the Rakaposhi Mountain. Other popular mountains in Hunza include Passu Peak, Ultra Peak, and Kuksel Sar. 
		The people of Hunza are extremely warm, welcoming, and friendly. They are food lovers that enjoy a wide range of food, especially sweet food, nuts, and fruit. In fact, the diet of the people of Hunza and Gilgit has long inspired much interest because of the historically long lives of the Hunza-ites. </p>

			RAKAPOSHI  
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> Rakaposhi is a mountain in the Karakoram mountain range in the Gilgit-Baltistan territory of Pakistan, about 100 km (62 mi) north of the city of Gilgit.[1] It is ranked 27th-highest in the world. Rakaposhi rises over the Bagrot, Nagar, and Danyor

Rakaposhi is the only mountain in the world with more than 5,000 meters height between base camp and the summit; by contrast all of the other tallest mountains in the world have less than 5,000 meters from base camp to top.[citation needed]

The first successful recorded ascent by non-natives was in 1958 by Mike Banks and Tom Patey, members of a British expedition, via the Southwest Spur/Ridge route.  </p>

		<h1>
			ALTIT FORT
		</h1> 
		<br>
		<p> The word 'Altit' means 'this side down' and the area around the fort is inhabited by Burusho people. In the 16th century the local prince married a princess from Baltistan who brought master Balti craftsmen to built two forts (Altit and Baltit forts). The people of Altit are said to belong to the White Huns, although not much research has gone into the matter. There are several theories about their origin but local indigenous origin holds much value among the people. It is also said[by whom?] that the present language Burushaski was brought here by the White Huns in 47 A.D but there is no link between Burushaski and any other language of today. According to the legend the first name for Altit village was Hunukushal, meaning the village of Huns.[4] The Huns came from the Huang-Ho valley in China. The name later changed to Broshal, translated as a village of Bruchiski speakers. They were spirit worshipers as Shamanism was in practice and also followed Buddhism and Hinduism. In the 15th century Islam was introduced. Around 1830 in turn many converted to Ismailism  </p>
